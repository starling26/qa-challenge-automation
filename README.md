# üöÄ QA Challenge Automation - Complete Test Suite

## ÔøΩ What This Project Does

This project contains **automated tests** that verify web pages work correctly. Think of it as a robot that tests websites for you - it fills out forms, clicks buttons, and checks if everything works as expected.

**üéØ Main Goal:** Automatically test the ParaBank contact form to ensure all validation rules work properly.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Playwright** - Modern web testing framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime environment
- **ParaBank** - Demo banking application for testing

## üì¶ What You Need Before Starting

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Check Your Node.js Version

**First, let's see what you have:**
```bash
node --version
```

**‚úÖ Perfect! You're ready if you see:**
- `v18.17.0` or higher
- `v20.x.x` (any version 20)
- `v21.x.x` or newer

**‚ö†Ô∏è You need to update if you see:**
- `v16.x.x` or lower
- `command not found` (Node.js not installed)
- No output at all

### üîÑ Node.js Installation/Update Guide

#### Option A: Fresh Install (Recommended for beginners)

1. **Visit:** https://nodejs.org
2. **Download:** The green "LTS" button (Long Term Support)
3. **Install:** Run the downloaded file
4. **Restart:** Your computer completely
5. **Verify:** Open terminal and run `node --version`

#### Option B: Using Node Version Manager (For developers)

**macOS/Linux users:**
```bash
# Install nvm (Node Version Manager)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash

# Restart your terminal, then:
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
nvm alias default 20

# Verify
node --version
```

**Windows users:**
1. Download **nvm-windows** from: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
2. Install it (Run as Administrator)
3. Open new Command Prompt as Administrator:
```cmd
nvm install 20.9.0
nvm use 20.9.0
node --version
```

#### Option C: Keep Your Current Version (Advanced)

If you can't change your Node.js version, you can try:
```bash
# Clear npm cache first
npm cache clean --force

# Try installing with compatibility flags
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### üíª How to Open Terminal/Command Prompt

**Windows:**
- Press `Windows + R` ‚Üí type `cmd` ‚Üí press Enter
- OR: Search "Command Prompt" in Start menu
- OR: Search "PowerShell" (more modern option)

**Mac:**
- Press `Cmd + Space` ‚Üí type "Terminal" ‚Üí press Enter
- OR: Applications ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Terminal

---

## üîß Setting Everything Up

### Step 1: Verify You're in the Right Place

```bash
# Check current directory
pwd

# You should see something like:

npm cache clean --force
npm install

# 2. If Node version issues:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 3. Delete everything and start fresh:
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Step 3: Install Browsers for Testing

```bash
npx playwright install
```

**What to expect:**
- ‚è≥ Takes 5-15 minutes
- üíæ Downloads ~300MB of browser files
- üåê Installs Chromium, Firefox, and Safari engines

**If installation fails:**
```bash
# Try force install:
npx playwright install --force

# Or install just Chrome:
npx playwright install chromium

# On Mac/Linux with permission issues:
sudo npx playwright install
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
npx playwright --version
```

**You should see:** Something like "Version 1.40.0" or newer

## üÜò Troubleshooting Guide

### ‚ùå Node.js Version Issues

**Problem:** "SyntaxError" or "Unexpected token" errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check your version
node --version

# If you see v16 or lower:
# 1. Go to https://nodejs.org
# 2. Download and install LTS version
# 3. Restart computer
# 4. Try again

# Alternative: Use Node Version Manager (see installation section above)
```

### ‚ùå Browser Installation Problems

**Problem:** "Browser not found" or download failures

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Try 1: Force reinstall
npx playwright install --force

# Try 2: Install specific browser
npx playwright install chromium

# Try 3: Check system requirements
npx playwright --help

# Try 4: Clear cache and retry
npm cache clean --force
npx playwright install
```

### ‚ùå Permission Denied Errors

**Windows:**
- Right-click Command Prompt ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"
- Or try: `npm install --unsafe-perm`

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Try with sudo (be careful!)
sudo npx playwright install

# Better: Fix npm permissions
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### ‚ùå Tests Fail Randomly

**This is normal!** Web tests can be flaky because:
- Network delays
- Page loading times
- System performance

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Run tests again (often fixes it)
npx playwright test

# Run with retries
npx playwright test --retries=3

# Run specific failing test
npx playwright test --grep "failing-test-name"
```

### ‚ùå Antivirus False Positives

**Problem:** Antivirus blocks browser downloads

**Solution:**
1. Temporarily disable antivirus
2. Add project folder to exceptions
3. Add `node_modules` folder to exceptions
4. Reinstall browsers

### ‚ùå Network/Firewall Issues

**Problem:** Downloads fail or tests can't reach websites

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Try different npm registry
npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/

# Check proxy settings if in corporate network
npm config list

# Install browsers manually if needed
npx playwright install --dry-run  # Shows what's needed
```

---

## üê≥ Alternative Setup with Docker

If Node.js issues persist, use Docker:

**Create Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0-focal

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npx playwright install

CMD ["npx", "playwright", "test"]
```

**Run with Docker:**
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t qa-automation .

# Run tests
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/test-results:/app/test-results qa-automation

# View reports
docker run --rm -p 9323:9323 -v $(pwd)/playwright-report:/app/playwright-report qa-automation npx playwright show-report --host 0.0.0.0
```

---

## üìä Understanding Test Results

### ‚úÖ When Tests Pass
```
Running 5 tests using 1 worker

‚úì TC_AUTO_001: Form visibility verification (2.3s)
‚úì TC_AUTO_002: Required field validation (1.8s)
‚úì TC_AUTO_003: Email format validation (2.1s)
‚úì TC_AUTO_004: Phone validation (1.9s)
‚úì TC_AUTO_005: Field length validation (2.0s)

5 passed (10.1s)
```

### ‚ùå When Tests Fail
```
Running 5 tests using 1 worker

‚úì TC_AUTO_001: Form visibility verification (2.3s)
‚úó TC_AUTO_002: Required field validation (5.0s)

1) TC_AUTO_002: Required field validation

   Error: Expected error message to be visible
   Actual: element not found
```

**Next steps for failures:**
1. Run `npx playwright show-report` to see details
2. Check screenshots in `test-results/` folder
3. Look at video recordings of the failure
4. Check if the website changed
